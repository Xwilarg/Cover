# Cover

Lot of Japanese songs have lot of covers, each of them have really different interpretation of the song (and a nice custom thumbnail)

Since I really like that variety, I made a website to display all of them side by side

## Website
 - [King](https://king.zirk.eu/king.html)
 - [Envy Baby](https://king.zirk.eu/envybaby.html)
 - [Usseewa](https://king.zirk.eu/usseewa.html)

## Philosophy
My general guideline is to take all covers that were posted by an official YouTube channel (that means I don't take the ones that were from some karaoke streaming)\
Also the cover must fit a minimal quality requirement (for that I mostly use the number of views)

## What now?
- Found a bug? Open an [issue](https://github.com/Xwilarg/King/issues)
- Made a new cool feature? Open a [pull request](https://github.com/Xwilarg/King/pulls)
- Just want to say how great this song is (or anything else)? Open a [discution topic](https://github.com/Xwilarg/King/discussions)
