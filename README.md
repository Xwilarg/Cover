# King

I was watching the new cover of "King" from Watame and I saw this comment on YouTube:
```
Friend: How many covers of KING have you heard?
Me: Yes.
```
So I was like: "I need a website that give all the different*s covers of this song" and boom here I am<br/>
**You can see this website [here](https://king.zirk.eu)**

My general guideline is to take all covers that were posted by an official YouTube channel (that means I don't take the ones that were from some karaoke streaming)
